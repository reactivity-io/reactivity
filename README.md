## Reactivity [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reactivity-io/reactivity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reactivity-io/reactivity)

Reactivity is an open-source WEB application offering a visual way to manage your activity in a reactive manner.

## Motivations

Today people a working in a distributed environment.
They are interracting with collaborators not co-located, dealing with different sources of data that are connected together all around the world.
The need to build a visual organization of that activity ready to react to any change from any source becomes a must to stay productive.

We believe in a reactive WEB application which helps people to view the activity that matters.
This application can be freely installed by anyone and is integrated with a lot of reliable open source products to achieve its mission.
By adopting the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) standard, the application is ready to scale with a few resources to face an unpredictible increase of the live data volume.

This is what Reactivity is and why we want to build it.

## Status of the project

The project is in an embryonic state.
We are designing the [first UX as well as technical fundations based on the Javascript and JVM ecosystems](https://github.com/reactivity-io/reactivity-doc/blob/master/index.adoc).

First milestone and backlog are defined [here](https://github.com/reactivity-io/reactivity/issues).
Contribution rules and tools to use are open issues are part of the current reflections.
Anyone is welcome to join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/myxit/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) and contribute to the project.
